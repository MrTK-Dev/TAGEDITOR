# Namespaces

## About

All classes are bound to a namespace to make it easy to reference functions from different scripts. This is also done to support a readable docs page by docfx.

## List of Namespaces

- User

Everything related to the user. This namespace contains classes to save & load user preferences and apply them to the application. It also controlls and applies themes and changes to the UI.
